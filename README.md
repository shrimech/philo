<h1>🎯 Project Overview</h1>
The Philosophers project is a challenge that deals with the classic dining philosophers problem, teaching the fundamentals of threading and processes. It emphasizes resource sharing, deadlock prevention, and concurrent programming concepts.

<h1>🧮 The Problem</h1>
The problem consists of philosophers sitting at a round table performing three actions:

Eating 🍽️
Thinking 🤔
Sleeping 😴
Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, and there's only one fork between each philosopher. The challenge is to design a solution where no philosopher will starve, avoiding deadlocks and optimizing resource use.

<h1>🛠️ Prerequisites</h1>
To compile and run this project, you will need:

GCC compiler
Make
pthread library
Unix-based operating system (Linux/Mac)


<h1>📚 Concepts Covered</h1>
Threads
Mutexes
Data races
Deadlocks
Resource sharing
Process synchronization
