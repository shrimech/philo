<h1>🎯 Project Overview</h1>
The Philosophers project is a challenge that deals with the classic dining philosophers problem, teaching the fundamentals of threading and processes. It emphasizes resource sharing, deadlock prevention, and concurrent programming concepts.

<h1>🧮 The Problem</h1>
The problem consists of philosophers sitting at a round table performing three actions:
<br><br>
Eating 🍽️<br>
Thinking 🤔<br>
Sleeping 😴<br><br>
Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, and there's only one fork between each philosopher. The challenge is to design a solution where no philosopher will starve, avoiding deadlocks and optimizing resource use.
